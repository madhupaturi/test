Create a new item for backup job status:
Name: Backup Job Status
Type: Zabbix agent (active)
Key: system.run[<command to check backup job status>]
Type of information: Numeric (unsigned)
Update interval: 1h (adjust as needed)
History storage period: 7d (adjust as needed)
The <command to check backup job status> will depend on your backup software. 

Step 2: Define Triggers
Triggers will alert you based on the collected data.
Create a new trigger for backup job failure:
Name: Backup Job Failed
Expression: {Template_Backup_Job_Status:system.run[<command to check backup job status>].last()}=1
Severity: High
Description: This trigger is activated if the backup job fails.

Step 3: Define Actions
Actions can notify you via email, SMS, or other methods when a trigger is activated.
Create a new action:
Name: Notify on Backup Job Failure
Event source: Trigger
Trigger name: Backup Job Failed

Step 4: Define Graphs (Optional)
Graphs can help visualize backup job status over time.
Create a new graph:
Name: Backup Job Status
Items: Add the item Backup Job Status to the graph.

Step 5: Create the Template
Combine all the above components into a single template.
Create a new template:
Name: Template_Backup_Job_Status
Groups: Templates/Your_Group

Add items, triggers, and graphs to the template:
Items: Add the Backup Job Status item.
Triggers: Add the Backup Job Failed trigger.
Graphs: Add the Backup Job Status graph.

Step 6: Link the Template to Hosts
Apply the template to the hosts that perform the backup jobs.
Go to Configuration > Hosts.
Select the host(s) where the backup job runs.
Go to the Templates tab.
Link the Template_Backup_Job_Status template.
